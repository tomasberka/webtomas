### ⚠️ What Needs Improvement

#### 1. **Too Broad Targeting** 🎯
**Problem:** The site addresses "e-shops, corporations, and personal brands" - too broad.

**Consequence:** Potential client thinks: *"It's for everyone = it's not specifically for me."*

**Solution:**
- Highlight primary target audience (e.g., "E-shops and personal brands in Prague")
- Create separate landing pages for different segments
- Emphasize specific industries in testimonials

#### 2. **CTA Confusion - Too Many Options** 🔘
**Problem:** Homepage has 5+ different CTAs:
- "Book appointment"
- "See results"
- "I want one of the spots"
- "Learn more about packages"
- "Start Quiz"

**Consequence:** [Hick's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law) - more options = slower decision = fewer conversions.

**Solution:**
- **1 primary CTA** per section: "Book Free Consultation"
- Secondary CTA can be "View Portfolio"
- Move Quiz to lead magnet email sequence

#### 3. **Missing Clear Pricing on Homepage** 💰
**Problem:** Packages show "Custom pricing" without indicative numbers.

**Consequence:** Client assumes either "too expensive" or "cheap = low quality."

**Solution:**
- Show indicative price range: "from 25,000 CZK"
- Or specific prices for main packages
- The "3 Reels for 15,000 CZK" offer is an excellent example - this should be standard

#### 4. **Navigation Is Overcrowded** 📍
**Current menu:** Packages | Portfolio | References | UGC/Actor | SocialVids | Blog | Quiz | FAQ | About | Contact

**Problem:** 10 menu items = cognitive overload.

**Solution:**
```
Proposed menu (5 items):
- Services (dropdown: Reels Packages, Creative Production, UGC)
- Portfolio
- References
- About
- [BUTTON] Book Now
```

#### 5. **Quiz on Homepage Is a Distraction** 🎮
**Problem:** Quiz "Do you make these Reels mistakes?" is an engagement tool, not a conversion tool.

**Consequence:** Visitor takes quiz → gets result → leaves without ordering.

**Solution:**
- Move quiz to separate landing page
- Use as lead magnet (email for results)
- Keep only main offer on homepage

## 👥 Target Audience Perspective

### 🎯 Persona 1: E-shop Owner (35-45 years)
**Name:** Martin  
**Business:** Small toy e-shop  
**Budget:** 20-50K CZK/month for marketing  
**Pain:** Needs social media content but has no time or staff

#### What Martin Sees Positively:
- ✅ "One day = month of content" - exactly what I need
- ✅ Reference from WikyHracky.cz (similar segment)
- ✅ 15,000 CZK offer looks attractive
- ✅ 150+ projects = experience

#### What Martin Is Missing:
- ❌ How much exactly does the "Growth" package cost? Do I need to call to find out?
- ❌ How long is the whole process from order to delivery?
- ❌ Where's the case study for e-shop? I see football and barber shop...
- ❌ What if I don't like it? Guarantee?

#### Martin's Decision:
> "The website looks good, but I need more information. I'll bookmark it and see... maybe I'll reach out next month."

**Result:** Delays decision → likely forgets

---

### 🎯 Persona 2: Social Media Manager (25-35 years)
**Name:** Petra  
**Company:** Works for mid-size company  
**Budget:** Needs to justify it to the boss  
**Pain:** Boss wants "more Reels like competitors"

#### What Petra Sees Positively:
- ✅ Portfolio with real examples - can show to boss
- ✅ Blog articles about Reels - educational content
- ✅ References from OICT and DEKRA - corporate clients
- ✅ Professional website appearance

#### What Petra Is Missing:
- ❌ PDF or presentation to send to boss
- ❌ ROI data: "We increased engagement by X%"
- ❌ Package comparison side by side
- ❌ Quick way to get a quote (form)

#### Petra's Decision:
> "I need to discuss this with my boss first. Where can I download some materials?"

**Result:** Looks for PDF → doesn't find → sends website link → boss doesn't click

---

### 🎯 Persona 3: Personal Brand / Influencer (20-30 years)
**Name:** Jakub  
**Business:** Fitness influencer, 15K followers  
**Budget:** 10-20K CZK one-time  
**Pain:** Wants more professional content than selfies

#### What Jakub Sees Positively:
- ✅ Vertical Reels samples - exactly what I want
- ✅ UGC / Actor section - interesting
- ✅ Fast delivery (within a week)
- ✅ Voiceover - maybe for future projects

#### What Jakub Is Missing:
- ❌ "From 25,000 CZK" - that's above my budget. Something smaller?
- ❌ Where are influencers in references? I only see companies
- ❌ Tomáš's Instagram/TikTok - want to see his style
- ❌ One quick option: "1 Reel for 5,000 CZK"

#### Jakub's Decision:
> "Great work, but it's too expensive for me. I'll try to find someone cheaper."

**Result:** Goes to cheaper competition
