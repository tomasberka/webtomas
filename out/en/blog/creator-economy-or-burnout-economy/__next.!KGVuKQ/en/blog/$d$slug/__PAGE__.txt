b:T756,<h2>Everyone Knows You Can Make a Living Creating Content</h2><p>61% of creators now work full-time.</p><p>Great. But here's the thing – <strong>creators are increasingly economically dependent on platforms that control algorithms</strong>, which are controlled by Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>This means when Instagram changes its algorithm (and they will this year, guaranteed), thousands of creators will face financial crisis.</p><h2>Cuts and Burns</h2><p>Creators say: "Sorry I've been away. I burned out." <strong>Burnout is the new norm.</strong> We see it everywhere. Creators shoot videos every day, stream every night, reply to comments immediately.</p><p>Why? Because the algorithm rewards consistency and frequency. Fewer videos = less reach. So creators are trapped. <strong>Either you create constantly, or you fall from relevance.</strong></p><h2>Diversification</h2><p>The only way to avoid this? Diversification. Not all eggs in one basket (Instagram). But that means more work. YouTube, TikTok, LinkedIn, your own newsletter, your own e-commerce.</p><p>94% of creators are preparing to diversify. That's right. But it also means the average creator must simultaneously be a marketer, technologist, designer, and consultant. That's a lot.</p><h2>The Future</h2><p>The future? The creator economy will grow. But it will also become more professionalised and competitive. <strong>The days when some teenager uploaded a video and gained a million followers without strategy or planning are gone.</strong> Now you need to be better, louder, more controversial, or more strategic.</p><p>Added to that is the fact that while creators think they're independent, they're actually increasingly dependent on platforms that can change the rules overnight.</p><p><strong><a href='/reels-packages'>Want a strategy that works long-term?
