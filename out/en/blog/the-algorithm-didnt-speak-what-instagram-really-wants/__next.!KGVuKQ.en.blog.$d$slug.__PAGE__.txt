b:T765,<h2>Instagram Won't Speak Honestly</h2><p>Their performance team says: "The algorithm prioritises authenticity and quality."</p><p><strong>Lie.</strong> Not entirely. The algorithm prioritises <strong>engagement</strong>. Full stop.</p><p>How is engagement measured? Watch time. Replay rate. Saves. Shares. Comments. <strong>Likes? They're last on the list.</strong> Instagram said it themselves – watch time is the new currency.</p><p>This means one thing: The algorithm rewards content that keeps you on the platform longer. Regardless of whether it's quality or unpleasant.</p><h2>Watch Time vs. Quality</h2><p>Videos that get millions aren't always quality. Sometimes they're precisely the videos that frustrate you, anger you, or shock you. Because <strong>emotion = watch time</strong>.</p><p>When you look at a viral video with 10 million views, it's often:</p><ul><li>Something shocking</li><li>Something hilarious</li><li>Something controversial</li></ul><p>Rarely is it an educational video on "How to Fix Your Boiler."</p><p>Instagram knows this. The algorithm optimises for it. If it sees people sitting on your video because there's drama or sex or something that stirs emotions, it will serve it to millions.</p><h2>Consequences</h2><p>Creators know this. That's exactly why you see so much content that's:</p><ul><li>Sexualised</li><li>Sensational</li><li>Manipulative</li><li>False</li></ul><p>Because the algorithm rewards them.</p><p><strong>And here's the most dangerous part – young people see that drama sells. That lies sell. That manipulation sells. And they start copying it.</strong></p><p><strong>The algorithm isn't your friend. It's a machine that optimises one thing – time spent on the platform. What keeps you there is what goes viral.</strong></p><p><strong><a href='/booking'>Need help with content that works ethically?
