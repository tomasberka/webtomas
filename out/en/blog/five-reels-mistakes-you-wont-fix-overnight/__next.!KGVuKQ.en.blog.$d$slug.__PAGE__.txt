b:T1110,<h2>Let's Be Honest</h2><p>Instagram's algorithm behaves like a harsh judge – it favours those who play by the rules. If you don't know the game, you've already lost. In 2025 and 2026, this means one thing: without quality and authenticity, you won't move an inch.</p><h2>Mistake #1: Long Intro – You're Killing Yourself</h2><p>When someone opens your Reel, you have exactly <strong>1.5 seconds</strong>. That's all. It's the time between "hmm, not sure" and "next". Everything after those 1.5 seconds is irrelevant to the algorithm.</p><p>Yet I see people starting their videos like this:</p><blockquote>"Hey everyone, I'm James and today I'll tell you about Reels. But first, I want to thank..."</blockquote><p><strong>That's not an intro. That's suicide.</strong></p><p>Instagram measures watch time, not completion rate. The longer someone watches, the more the algorithm believes your content is worth it. But if someone leaves in the first second, you're done.</p><p><strong>The right way:</strong> Jump straight in. A gag, tension, a question – anything that pulls the brain out of autopilot. Companies that get this open with their most interesting moment. No intros, no logos, no "Welcome to our channel."</p><h2>Mistake #2: Lighting – Like Instagram Stories from 2012</h2><p>Bad lighting isn't just a technical detail. It's the first thing the brain registers, thinking: "This looks cheap. Never heard of it, must be cheap content."</p><p>The simplest solution is also the cheapest. <strong>A window.</strong> Natural light from a window. That's it. You don't need thousands of pounds worth of reflectors or professional LED panels (though they help).</p><p>Here's the controversial bit: People actually prefer high-quality content that looks like "shot on my mate's phone" over hyper-professional, sterile content. That's the UGC (User Generated Content) phenomenon. When a video looks too polished, the brain says: "Ad, skip." When it looks authentic, even if technically perfect, the brain thinks: "Wait, that's interesting."</p><h2>Mistake #3: No Captions – 40% Lost</h2><p>Here's a stat that should hurt:</p><p><strong>40% of people watch videos without sound.</strong></p><p>Forty percent. That's not a marginal group. That's nearly half your audience. And you're sending them audio-only content? That's like sending blind people to the cinema.</p><p>Captions aren't decoration. They're your business model. Instagram rewards videos with captions – the system marks them as more accessible and gives them greater reach.</p><p>Here's what London marketers don't tell you: with good captions, <strong>you don't need to be a great speaker</strong>. Captions compensate.</p><h2>Mistake #4: No Call-to-Action – You're Only Helping Yourself</h2><p>I see this a million times: Someone shoots an amazing video. Original, interesting, great lighting and captions. But then it ends... and nothing. Just sits there.</p><p>Without telling people what to do.</p><p>Instagram (and every social network) runs on engagement. When someone sees a video and doesn't know what to do with it, they do nothing. The algorithm notices and thinks: "Hmm, this video didn't engage people enough to take action." Reach drops.</p><p>Tell them exactly what to do. "Comment below which mistake you're making." Or "Share this with a friend who needs it." Or "Save this for later."</p><p><strong>CTA (Call-to-Action) is the most important thing you can put at the end. Companies that realised this have 3-4x higher engagement.</strong></p><h2>Mistake #5: Boring – Sometimes Boring Content Is Just... Boring</h2><p>Finally. The worst evil. A video can have everything right – lighting, captions, CTA, short intro – but if it's boring, it's simply boring.</p><p><strong>Three things the brain remembers:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Emotion</strong> – the video made you laugh, touched you, angered you</li><li><strong>Learning</strong> – you learned something new</li><li><strong>Inspiration</strong> – you saw something that changed your perspective</li></ul><p>If your video does none of these, why would anyone watch?</p><p><strong>Figure out what makes your content interesting to people, and worry about the details later.</strong></p><p><strong><a href='/reels-packages'>Want to find out where you're going wrong? Book a strategy call →</a></strong></p>7:["$","div",null,{"className":"prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert mx-auto max-w-none prose-headings:font-bold prose-headings:text-foreground prose-headings:tracking-tight prose-p:text-muted-foreground prose-p:leading-relaxed prose-strong:text-foreground prose-strong:font-bold prose-ul:text-muted-foreground prose-li:marker:text-primary prose-a:text-primary prose-a:no-underline hover:prose-a:underline prose-img:rounded-xl prose-img:shadow-lg","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$b"}}]
