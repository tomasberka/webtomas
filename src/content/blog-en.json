        "content": "<h2>Why do my Reels have no reach?</h2><p>If you invest time in creating Instagram Reels but the result is only 50 views and no new clients, you are not alone. Many business profiles face the same problem. Here is how to fix it.</p><h2>1. Weak Intro and Zero Engagement</h2><p><strong>Symptom:</strong> Most people turn off your video within a few seconds.</p><p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The first few seconds are critical. If you don't start with a hook, the algorithm stops offering it. A weak intro – like a long company logo – causes viewers to scroll away.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> Focus on the first 2–3 seconds. Start with something surprising or visually attractive. Instead of a static logo, show the final result immediately.</p><h2>2. Recycled Content or “Reels Routine”</h2><p><strong>Symptom:</strong> Your videos look the same. You use the same template or recycle TikTok videos with a watermark.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> Innovate format and content. Alternate styles: speak to the camera one time, make a photo collage next. It is also important to remove any TikTok watermarks.</p><h2>3. Bad Timing and Zero Interaction</h2><p><strong>Symptom:</strong> The video looks great, but you posted it when your audience is offline. Plus, you don't reply to comments.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> Focus on timing and community management. Ideally, publish when your fans are online.</p><h2>4. Too Salesy Without Value</h2><p><strong>Symptom:</strong> Every video is an ad – “buy this”. Viewers get nothing but an offer.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> Try to give value or emotion in every video. Instead of a “product report”, show a tip, trick, guide, or customer story. The 80/20 rule works great.</p><h2>5. You Don't Know Your Audience</h2><p><strong>Symptom:</strong> You create generic videos that aim “nowhere”.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> Clarify who you want to reach and adapt the content to them, not yourself. Imagine one ideal follower and “tell” the Reel to them.</p><p><strong>Want to find out how you are doing? <a href='/booking'>Book a free audit</a> and reveal where your biggest reserve is!</strong></p>",

        "content": "<h2>Do you know how much a video costs?</h2><p>You may have heard the answer: “It depends…”. Yes, the budget depends on many factors. But today we will get specific.</p><h2>Short Social Video (Reels, Promo Clip)</h2><p><strong>Price:</strong> If you create it in-house, direct costs can be zero. For external production, low-budget Reels cost hundreds. For full-service, expect more.</p><p><strong>What's included:</strong> Cameraman/editor work and basic production. Short shoot, basic edit, color grading.</p><h2>Corporate Video (Presentation, Case Study)</h2><p><strong>Price:</strong> This ranges from mid-hundreds to thousands. Lower end gives you a simple one-day shoot. Higher end brings more shooting days and advanced graphics.</p><p><strong>What's included:</strong> Complete service: pre-production (script), production (crew, lights) and post-production (edit, grading, music, voiceover).</p><h2>TV Spot (Commercial)</h2><p><strong>Price:</strong> Professional TV commercials cost tens of thousands. The upper limit practically doesn't exist.</p><p><strong>What's included:</strong> Everything: creative concept, director, large crew, actors, locations, make-up, costumes, special effects, licensed music.</p><h2>What Influences the Price?</h2><ul><li><strong>Length:</strong> Longer video = more work.</li><li><strong>Shooting Days & Locations:</strong> More days = higher costs.</li><li><strong>Crew Size:</strong> More experts = higher quality and price.</li><li><strong>Actors:</strong> Fees and casting cost money.</li><li><strong>Post-production:</strong> Animation and 3D effects are expensive.</li></ul><p><strong>Not sure which video type fits you? <a href='/booking'>Contact us for a free consultation</a>.</strong></p>",

Not every video goes viral.</p><h2>Truth #2: One Viral Hit Won't Save You, Consistency Will</h2><p>I used to believe one viral video was enough. Mistake. A viral hit is a nice ego boost, but often short-lived.</p><h2>Truth #3: Trends Won't Save You – Content Must Fit You</h2><p>A trend is not a strategy. If I sell accounting services, a TikTok dance won't bring clients. Authenticity is worth more.</p><h2>Truth #4: Reels Don't Sell By Themselves</h2><p>Reels are great for attention – but they won't sell for you without a follow-up process. Give a clear CTA: “Click the link in bio”.</p><h2>Truth #5: Success = Lots of Trial and Error</h2><p>Nobody has a 100% recipe for success. Even after 500 videos, I can't say “I know everything”. Creating Reels is constant experimentation.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Go all in, but with open eyes. <strong>If you need a helping hand with Reels, <a href='/booking'>get in touch</a>.</strong></p>",

Missing Captions</h2><p>Up to 40% of people watch videos without sound. If you don't have captions, you lose half your audience.</p><h2>4.
