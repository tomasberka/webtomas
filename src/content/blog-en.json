        "content": "<h2>Let's Be Honest</h2><p>Instagram's algorithm behaves like a harsh judge – it favours those who play by the rules. If you don't know the game, you've already lost. In 2025 and 2026, this means one thing: without quality and authenticity, you won't move an inch.</p><h2>Mistake #1: Long Intro – You're Killing Yourself</h2><p>When someone opens your Reel, you have exactly <strong>1.5 seconds</strong>. That's all. It's the time between \"hmm, not sure\" and \"next\". Everything after those 1.5 seconds is irrelevant to the algorithm.</p><p>Yet I see people starting their videos like this:</p><blockquote>\"Hey everyone, I'm James and today I'll tell you about Reels. But first, I want to thank...\"</blockquote><p><strong>That's not an intro. That's suicide.</strong></p><p>Instagram measures watch time, not completion rate. The longer someone watches, the more the algorithm believes your content is worth it. But if someone leaves in the first second, you're done.</p><p><strong>The right way:</strong> Jump straight in. A gag, tension, a question – anything that pulls the brain out of autopilot. Companies that get this open with their most interesting moment. No intros, no logos, no \"Welcome to our channel.\"</p><h2>Mistake #2: Lighting – Like Instagram Stories from 2012</h2><p>Bad lighting isn't just a technical detail. It's the first thing the brain registers, thinking: \"This looks cheap. Never heard of it, must be cheap content.\"</p><p>The simplest solution is also the cheapest. <strong>A window.</strong> Natural light from a window. That's it. You don't need thousands of pounds worth of reflectors or professional LED panels (though they help).</p><p>Here's the controversial bit: People actually prefer high-quality content that looks like \"shot on my mate's phone\" over hyper-professional, sterile content. That's the UGC (User Generated Content) phenomenon. When a video looks too polished, the brain says: \"Ad, skip.\" When it looks authentic, even if technically perfect, the brain thinks: \"Wait, that's interesting.\"</p><h2>Mistake #3: No Captions – 40% Lost</h2><p>Here's a stat that should hurt:</p><p><strong>40% of people watch videos without sound.</strong></p><p>Forty percent. That's not a marginal group. That's nearly half your audience. And you're sending them audio-only content? That's like sending blind people to the cinema.</p><p>Captions aren't decoration. They're your business model. Instagram rewards videos with captions – the system marks them as more accessible and gives them greater reach.</p><p>Here's what London marketers don't tell you: with good captions, <strong>you don't need to be a great speaker</strong>. Captions compensate.</p><h2>Mistake #4: No Call-to-Action – You're Only Helping Yourself</h2><p>I see this a million times: Someone shoots an amazing video. Original, interesting, great lighting and captions. But then it ends... and nothing. Just sits there.</p><p>Without telling people what to do.</p><p>Instagram (and every social network) runs on engagement. When someone sees a video and doesn't know what to do with it, they do nothing. The algorithm notices and thinks: \"Hmm, this video didn't engage people enough to take action.\" Reach drops.</p><p>Tell them exactly what to do. \"Comment below which mistake you're making.\" Or \"Share this with a friend who needs it.\" Or \"Save this for later.\"</p><p><strong>CTA (Call-to-Action) is the most important thing you can put at the end. Companies that realised this have 3-4x higher engagement.</strong></p><h2>Mistake #5: Boring – Sometimes Boring Content Is Just... Boring</h2><p>Finally. The worst evil. A video can have everything right – lighting, captions, CTA, short intro – but if it's boring, it's simply boring.</p><p><strong>Three things the brain remembers:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Emotion</strong> – the video made you laugh, touched you, angered you</li><li><strong>Learning</strong> – you learned something new</li><li><strong>Inspiration</strong> – you saw something that changed your perspective</li></ul><p>If your video does none of these, why would anyone watch?</p><p><strong>Figure out what makes your content interesting to people, and worry about the details later.</strong></p><p><strong><a href='/reels-packages'>Want to find out where you're going wrong?

        "content": "<h2>The Facts Are Clear</h2><p>93% of marketers confirm that UGC outperforms branded content, and UGC posts generate up to <strong>9x higher engagement</strong> than brand-created content.</p><h2>Why Does UGC Win?</h2><p>It's psychological. The brain runs an investigation the moment it sees content. First, it checks: \"Is this an ad?\" If yes, the internal filter activates, and the person ignores the content 90% of the time.</p><p>But when it looks like it's from someone like you and me (even if it's actually a targeted brand campaign), that filter doesn't activate. The brain thinks: \"This is someone like me's story. I like this.\"</p><p><strong>Here's the controversy:</strong> The best modern advertising doesn't look like advertising at all. It's a lie. It's manipulation. But very effective manipulation.</p><p>Brands that get this exploit psychological processes. They exploit the fact that people think they're seeing \"real content from a real person,\" when in reality it's a deliberately prepared campaign.</p><h2>Why Do Brands Do This?</h2><p>Simple. <strong>Conversion rate.</strong> UGC campaigns generate up to 29% higher conversion rates than traditional advertising. And they're cheaper to produce.</p><p>Traditional TV advertising? Costs millions. Studio prep, filming, editing, agency at every step... Then the result? People won't even watch.</p><p>UGC? Find five \"ordinary\" creators, give them the product, tell them to talk about it naturally, and they create the content themselves. Costs a fraction, results are 9x better.</p><h2>Real UGC vs. Fake UGC</h2><p>Here's the irony: Real UGC (when someone buys your product and writes about it) is great. But it's unpredictable.</p><p>So brands said: \"Let's control it.\" They invented \"UGC campaigns\" where they hire creators, give them a script (quietly, so it doesn't look like a script), and they then shoot \"natural\" videos.</p><p>I do these things myself. I see it. When you look at an \"authentic\" video from someone playing in a UGC campaign, you can see where authenticity ends and direction begins. But 90% of people don't see it. Their brain tells them it's real, and that's enough.</p><p><strong>This is the darkest place in modern marketing.

        "content": "<h2>Why do my Reels have no reach?</h2><p>If you invest time in creating Instagram Reels but the result is only 50 views and no new clients, you are not alone. Many business profiles face the same problem. Here is how to fix it.</p><h2>1. Weak Intro and Zero Engagement</h2><p><strong>Symptom:</strong> Most people turn off your video within a few seconds.</p><p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The first few seconds are critical. If you don't start with a hook, the algorithm stops offering it. A weak intro – like a long company logo – causes viewers to scroll away.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> Focus on the first 2–3 seconds. Start with something surprising or visually attractive. Instead of a static logo, show the final result immediately.</p><h2>2. Recycled Content or \"Reels Routine\"</h2><p><strong>Symptom:</strong> Your videos look the same. You use the same template or recycle TikTok videos with a watermark.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> Innovate format and content. Alternate styles: speak to the camera one time, make a photo collage next. It is also important to remove any TikTok watermarks.</p><h2>3. Bad Timing and Zero Interaction</h2><p><strong>Symptom:</strong> The video looks great, but you posted it when your audience is offline. Plus, you don't reply to comments.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> Focus on timing and community management. Ideally, publish when your fans are online.</p><h2>4. Too Salesy Without Value</h2><p><strong>Symptom:</strong> Every video is an ad – \"buy this\". Viewers get nothing but an offer.</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> Try to give value or emotion in every video. Instead of a \"product report\", show a tip, trick, guide, or customer story. The 80/20 rule works great.</p><h2>5. You Don't Know Your Audience</h2><p><strong>Symptom:</strong> You create generic videos that aim \"nowhere\".</p><p><strong>Cure:</strong> Clarify who you want to reach and adapt the content to them, not yourself.

        "date": "2025-01-03",
        "content": "<h2>Truth #1: Most Reels Won't Succeed (And That's OK)</h2><p>Nobody says this out loud — you mostly see success stories. But the reality after 500+ productions? <strong>Around 80% of Reels perform average</strong>. Not every video goes viral. Not every post brings enquiries.</p><p>And that's completely fine. Social media is a numbers game. Out of every 10 Reels, 1–2 will perform well above average, 6–7 will deliver steady impressions, and 1–2 might flop. The key isn't perfection — it's <strong>volume and consistency</strong>.</p><p>One of my clients — a restaurant chain in Prague — posted 3 Reels per week for 3 months. Most averaged 2,000–5,000 views. But 4 videos topped 100K, and those four alone brought in over <strong>200 new followers and 15 table reservations</strong>. That's the real game.</p><h2>Truth #2: One Viral Hit Won't Save You — Consistency Will</h2><p>I used to believe one viral video was enough. Big mistake. A viral Reel is a nice ego boost, but the effect fades within days. <strong>The algorithm rewards accounts that post regularly</strong> — not accounts with one lucky hit.</p><p>Here's what the data shows: accounts posting 4–7 Reels per week see <strong>3x more overall reach</strong> than accounts posting one \"perfect\" video per month. Instagram's algorithm pushes content from active creators.</p><p>My recommendation? Start with <strong>3 Reels per week minimum</strong>. Use a content calendar. Batch your filming — shoot 6–8 videos in one session, then schedule them across 2 weeks. This is exactly what my <a href='/reels-packages'>Reels packages</a> include.</p><h2>Truth #3: Trends Won't Save You — Content Must Fit Your Brand</h2><p>A trend is not a strategy. If you're selling accounting services, a TikTok dance won't bring clients. If you run a B2B SaaS, lip-syncing to pop songs feels out of place.</p><p><strong>Authenticity beats trends every time.</strong> The best-performing Reels I've produced are ones where the client's genuine expertise shines through. A fitness trainer explaining proper deadlift form. A dentist debunking teeth-whitening myths. A restaurant chef showing how they prep their signature dish.</p><p>Use trends as seasoning, not the main course. Adapt trending audio or formats to your niche — don't force your brand into a mould that doesn't fit.</p><h2>Truth #4: Reels Don't Sell By Themselves — You Need a Funnel</h2><p>Reels are incredible for <strong>attention and awareness</strong> — but they won't close sales without a follow-up process. I've seen businesses with 50K+ Reel views and zero enquiries. Why? No CTA, no landing page, no next step.</p><p>Every Reel should have a purpose:</p><ul><li><strong>Awareness Reels</strong> → Drive profile visits and follows</li><li><strong>Trust-building Reels</strong> → Showcase expertise, behind-the-scenes, results</li><li><strong>Conversion Reels</strong> → Direct CTA: \"Link in bio\", \"DM us the word OFFER\", \"Book a free consultation\"</li></ul><p>The magic ratio? <strong>60% trust content, 30% awareness, 10% direct selling</strong>. Most businesses flip this — and that's why their Reels feel \"salesy\" and underperform.</p><h2>Truth #5: Success = Lots of Trial, Error, and Data</h2><p>Nobody has a 100% recipe for success. Even after 500+ videos, I still can't predict which Reel will blow up. But I <em>can</em> stack the odds by analysing what works:</p><ul><li><strong>Track your hook rate</strong> — What percentage watch past 3 seconds? Below 40%? Your opening needs work.</li><li><strong>Monitor save rate</strong> — Saves signal deep value. Educational content gets saved more than entertainment.</li><li><strong>Watch completion rate</strong> — If people drop off at 50%, your videos may be too long or lose momentum.</li><li><strong>Test one variable at a time</strong> — Change the hook, keep everything else the same. Then test a different thumbnail. Isolate what actually makes a difference.</li></ul><p>Creating Reels is constant experimentation. The creators who win are the ones who <strong>treat it like a system, not a lottery</strong>.</p><h3>The Bottom Line</h3><p>Go all in on Reels — but with open eyes. Expect most content to be average. Post consistently. Build a funnel behind your videos. Analyse the data. And never stop testing.</p><p><strong>Need a partner who's been through 500+ Reels productions and knows what actually works? <a href='/booking'>Book a free strategy call</a> — let's build your content system together.</strong></p>",

        "date": "2025-10-15",
        "content": "<h2>Mistake #1: You're Losing Viewers in the First 3 Seconds</h2><p>Instagram's internal data is clear: <strong>viewers decide within 1.5–3 seconds</strong> whether to keep watching or scroll past. That means your opening is everything.</p><p>The biggest offenders? Long logo animations, generic \"Hey guys\" intros, and slow panning shots of nothing. By the time you get to the point, your audience is gone.</p><p><strong>How to fix it:</strong></p><ul><li>Start mid-action — show the most interesting moment first</li><li>Use a provocative text hook: \"Stop making this mistake\" or \"This changed everything\"</li><li>Jump straight to the value — no warm-up, no intro</li><li>Use movement in the first frame — static openings get scrolled past</li></ul><p>I test hooks obsessively with my clients. One simple hook change took a fitness brand's average retention from 25% to 62%. Same content, different opening.</p><h2>Mistake #2: Terrible Lighting Is Killing Your Credibility</h2><p>You don't need a €10,000 camera. A modern smartphone shoots stunning video. But <strong>without good lighting, even the best camera produces content that looks amateur</strong>.</p><p>The brain associates dark, grainy footage with low quality and low trust. Bright, clean footage signals professionalism — even when shot on an iPhone.</p><p><strong>How to fix it:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Free option:</strong> Face a large window. Natural daylight is the best light source available — and it costs nothing</li><li><strong>Budget option (€30–50):</strong> Ring light or LED panel. Game-changer for indoor shooting</li><li><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Avoid overhead fluorescent lights and mixed colour temperatures. They make skin look sickly</li><li><strong>Time matters:</strong> Golden hour (1 hour before sunset) outdoors creates cinematic magic</li></ul><h2>Mistake #3: No Captions = Losing 40% of Your Audience</h2><p>Research shows <strong>up to 85% of social media video is watched without sound</strong>. On public transport, in offices, in bed next to a sleeping partner — people scroll silently.</p><p>If your Reel relies on spoken word with no captions, you're invisible to most of your audience.</p><p><strong>How to fix it:</strong></p><ul><li>Use Instagram's built-in auto-captions or CapCut for accurate subtitles</li><li>Style your captions to match your brand — font, colour, position</li><li>Add emphasis to key words with bold or highlight effects</li><li>Consider burned-in captions vs. platform-generated ones for better control</li></ul><p>Pro tip: Captions also <strong>boost watch time</strong>. People who read along stay engaged longer — giving the algorithm a positive signal to push your video further.</p><h2>Mistake #4: No Call to Action — So Viewers Do… Nothing</h2><p>Your Reel gets 10,000 views. Great. But what happens next? If you don't tell viewers what to do, they'll simply scroll to the next video and forget you existed.</p><p><strong>Every Reel needs a purpose and a CTA:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Awareness goal:</strong> \"Follow for more tips\" or \"Share this with a friend who needs to hear it\"</li><li><strong>Engagement goal:</strong> \"Comment your biggest struggle with X\" or \"Save this for later\"</li><li><strong>Conversion goal:</strong> \"Click the link in bio for a free consultation\" or \"DM me REELS\"</li></ul><p>The CTA should match the content type. Educational content → save CTA. Entertaining content → share CTA. Sales content → link/DM CTA. <strong>Don't ask people to do 5 things — pick one clear action.</strong></p><h2>Mistake #5: Your Content Is Simply Boring</h2><p>Harsh but true. If your Reel doesn't <strong>entertain, educate, or inspire</strong> within the first few seconds, the algorithm will bury it. Instagram tracks completion rate, saves, and shares. Boring content scores zero on all three.</p><p><strong>The \"Would I stop scrolling for this?\" test:</strong></p><ul><li>Does the hook create curiosity or tension?</li><li>Does the content deliver on the promise?</li><li>Would YOU watch this if it wasn't your brand?</li><li>Does it tell a story, teach something useful, or trigger an emotion?</li></ul><p><strong>Content ideas that always perform:</strong></p><ul><li>Before/after transformations</li><li>Behind-the-scenes processes</li><li>\"X things I wish I knew before…\" lists</li><li>Customer reaction videos</li><li>Quick tutorials or tips</li></ul><h3>Bonus: The Algorithm Isn't Your Enemy</h3><p>Instagram's algorithm is simple: <strong>it promotes content that keeps people on the platform</strong>. If your Reel makes people watch to the end, save it, comment on it, or share it — the algorithm will push it to more people. Fix these 5 mistakes, and you're giving the algorithm exactly what it wants.</p><p><strong>Want an expert to handle your Reels strategy?

        "content": "<h2>People Hate Ads — And Your Creative Is the Problem</h2><p>Nobody opens Facebook or Instagram to watch advertisements. People want to be entertained, catch up with friends, or scroll mindlessly before bed. <strong>Your ad is an interruption</strong> — and if it looks like one, it gets skipped instantly.</p><p>Meta's own data shows that <strong>creative quality accounts for up to 56% of ad performance</strong>. Not targeting. Not budget. Not bidding strategy. The video itself is what makes or breaks your campaign.</p><p>So why are most businesses still running ads that look like TV commercials from 2010? Stock footage, corporate voiceovers, bullet-point feature lists. The scroll rate on these is brutal — over 90% of viewers skip within 2 seconds.</p><h2>The \"Native Content\" Rule: Your Ad Must Not Look Like an Ad</h2><p>The highest-performing Facebook and Instagram ads in 2025 have one thing in common: <strong>they look like organic content</strong>. They look like something a friend posted. Like a TikTok. Like a genuine product review.</p><p>This style is called <strong>UGC (User Generated Content)</strong>, and the results speak for themselves:</p><ul><li>UGC-style ads generate <strong>4x higher click-through rates</strong> than traditional branded ads</li><li>They achieve <strong>29% higher conversion rates</strong> according to Nielsen research</li><li>Cost-per-acquisition drops by <strong>30–50%</strong> because the platform rewards engaging content with cheaper impressions</li></ul><p>Why does UGC work so well? Because <strong>people trust people, not brands</strong>. A real person talking to camera about a product feels authentic. A polished corporate ad feels like a sales pitch.</p><h2>3 Types of Video Ads That Actually Convert</h2><h3>1. The Problem-Solution Ad</h3><p>Open with a pain point your audience recognises. \"Tired of spending hours on social media with zero results?\" Then show how your product/service solves it. End with a clear CTA.</p><p><strong>Why it works:</strong> It mirrors how people think — they're searching for solutions to problems they already have.</p><h3>2. The Testimonial Ad</h3><p>A real customer talking about their experience. No script, no teleprompter — just genuine reaction. \"I was sceptical, but after 2 weeks…\"</p><p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Social proof is the most powerful persuasion tool. Seeing a real person vouch for your product eliminates objections.</p><h3>3. The \"Day in the Life\" / Behind-the-Scenes Ad</h3><p>Show your process, your team, your workspace. Make people feel like insiders. This builds brand connection and trust before you ever ask for a sale.</p><p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Transparency signals confidence. If you're willing to show how things are made, people trust the quality.</p><h2>The Emotional Formula: Feel → Think → Act</h2><p>A boring list of product specifications interests no one. \"Our software has 47 features and integrates with 12 platforms\" — who cares?</p><p>Instead, show how the person will <strong>FEEL</strong> when they use your product:</p><ul><li>Show the frustration BEFORE (the problem)</li><li>Show the relief AFTER (the solution)</li><li>Make them imagine themselves in that \"after\" state</li></ul><p>The formula is simple: <strong>Hook (grab attention) → Story (create emotion) → Offer (clear CTA)</strong>. Every successful ad follows this structure, whether it's 15 seconds or 60 seconds.</p><h2>How Much Should You Spend on Creative vs. Media?</h2><p>Most businesses spend 95% on media buying and 5% on creative. <strong>That ratio is backwards.</strong> If your creative is weak, no amount of budget will fix it — you're just paying to push bad content to more people.</p><p>My recommendation: allocate at least <strong>20–30% of your ad budget to creative production</strong>. Test 3–5 different video concepts per campaign. Kill the losers, scale the winners. This iterative approach consistently outperforms the \"one perfect ad\" strategy.</p><h3>Ready to Stop Wasting Ad Spend?</h3><p>I create UGC-style video ads that blend seamlessly into social feeds and drive measurable results. From concept and scripting to filming and editing — everything designed for conversion, not just views.</p><p><strong>Want an ad that looks natural and actually sells? <a href='/booking'>Book a free strategy call</a> and let's build your next winning creative.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<h2>Why Event Video Is Non-Negotiable in 2025</h2><p>Hosting a conference without professional video in 2025 is like running a restaurant without a website. <strong>Event video</strong> builds authority, attracts sponsors, and sells tickets to your next event.</p><p>The data speaks clearly: events with professional video coverage see <strong>300% higher registration rates for following editions</strong>. LinkedIn posts with event footage generate <strong>5x more engagement</strong> than static photos.</p><h2>Event Video Trends for 2025</h2><h3>1. Same-Day Highlights</h3><p>Waiting 2 weeks for your event video is dead. Clients want <strong>highlight reels the same evening</strong> — for LinkedIn, Instagram Stories, and WhatsApp groups. Sharing while the experience is fresh dramatically boosts engagement.</p><h3>2. CEO & Thought Leader Interviews</h3><p>Main stage footage is baseline, but <strong>CEO and VIP interviews</strong> are what actually drives value. A 60-second interview on LinkedIn can generate thousands of views and position both the speaker and organiser as industry leaders.</p><h3>3. Multi-Camera as Standard</h3><p>One camera for an entire conference? Sure, it's cheaper. But the result looks like a school project. <strong>Minimum 2 cameras</strong> are now expected — one on stage, one for B-roll and audience reactions.</p><h3>4. Short-Form Over Long-Form</h3><p>Nobody watches a 45-minute keynote recording. The trend: <strong>short clips (30-90s) for social media</strong> + full recording for archives. One conference can yield 10-20 short videos.</p><h3>5. Livestreaming Is Standard</h3><p>Hybrid events are here to stay. <strong>Livestream to YouTube, LinkedIn, or a custom platform</strong> extends your event's reach to a global audience.</p><h2>Event Video Pricing Across Europe</h2><h3>Berlin / Vienna</h3><ul><li><strong>From €3,500</strong> — Full day, 2 cameras, 1 edited video (5-10 min), travel included</li></ul><h3>London</h3><ul><li><strong>From €4,200</strong> — Full day, 2 cameras, 1 edited video (5-10 min), travel included</li></ul><h3>Prague</h3><ul><li><strong>From €1,200 (25,000 CZK)</strong> — Full day, 1 camera, basic package</li></ul><h3>Other European Cities</h3><ul><li><strong>From €3,500</strong> — Full day, 2 cameras, travel included</li></ul><h3>Multi-City Tour</h3><ul><li><strong>3+ cities = 15% discount</strong> — Consistent quality, one videographer, one point of contact</li></ul><h3>ROI Calculation</h3><p>Investment: €3,500 for a Berlin event video. You create: 1 highlight video, 3 CEO interviews, 10+ social clips, material for selling next year's tickets. If video helps sell <strong>20 extra tickets at €200 each</strong>, that's <strong>€4,000 from a €3,500 investment</strong>. Plus ongoing brand value from LinkedIn content.</p><h2>How to Choose an Event Videographer</h2><p><strong>Questions to ask:</strong></p><ul><li>Do they have B2B event portfolio? (Weddings ≠ conferences)</li><li>Can they handle CEO interviews? (Discretion is essential)</li><li>Do they offer same-day delivery? (Social media won't wait)</li><li>Do they carry backup equipment? (Things break)</li><li>Do they understand your industry? (Tech ≠ gala dinner)</li></ul><p><strong>Red flags:</strong> No event portfolio, no B2B experience, no backup gear, can't do interviews.</p><h2>Pre-Event Checklist</h2><ul><li>✅ Venue details (layout, power, lighting)</li><li>✅ Event schedule with key moments</li><li>✅ Speaker list for interviews</li><li>✅ Branding assets (logo, colours, fonts)</li><li>✅ Filming permissions</li><li>✅ Contingency plan</li></ul><p><strong><a href='/services/international-event-video'>Get a custom quote for your next event — free consultation →</a></strong></p>",

        "content": "<h2>The Language Problem at International Conferences</h2><p>Berlin, Vienna, London, Prague — Europe's conference scene is international by default. Your speakers might be from 5 different countries. Your audience is a mix of locals and expats. And your moderator speaks... only English?</p><p>Here's the problem: <strong>language barriers kill engagement</strong>. When half the room doesn't fully connect with the moderator, you lose Q&A participation, networking energy, and the moments that make events memorable.</p><h2>What a Bilingual Moderator Changes</h2><ul><li><strong>Seamless language switching</strong> — Introduce a Czech speaker in Czech, run Q&A in English, summarise in both. No awkward pauses, no interpreters needed.</li><li><strong>Every attendee feels included</strong> — Nobody is lost. Local and international guests get equal attention.</li><li><strong>Better interviews for video</strong> — A moderator who speaks the speaker's mother tongue gets more authentic, relaxed responses on camera.</li></ul><h2>The Filmmaker Advantage</h2><p>Most moderators don't understand cameras. But when your moderator has a <strong>filmmaker background</strong>, they instinctively know where the cameras are, how to position themselves, and how to create \"moment-worthy\" content. Your event video looks significantly better because the host is camera-aware.</p><h2>Ideal Use Cases</h2><ul><li>Tech conferences with international speakers (Berlin, Vienna, Prague)</li><li>Startup demo days and pitch events</li><li>Corporate summits with HQ visitors</li><li>Product launches for global products</li><li>Panel discussions with multilingual panelists</li></ul><h2>Pricing</h2><p>Half-day (4 hours): €800. Full-day (8 hours): €1,400. Multi-day: €1,200/day. Virtual events: from €600.</p><p><strong>Combo deal:</strong> Book event moderation + video coverage together for 15% off.

        "content": "<h2>Why This Checklist Matters</h2><p>After 50+ conferences filmed, I know one thing for certain: <strong>preparation accounts for 80% of the result</strong>. The best event videos don't come from improvisation — they come from thorough planning. Here's my complete checklist.</p><h2>1. Venue Technical Details</h2><p>Before the event, find out: What's the lighting like in the main hall? Where are the power outlets? Is there a balcony or gallery for overhead shots? What's the acoustics like? These things affect video quality more than an expensive camera.</p><h2>2. Event Schedule & Run-Down</h2><p>I need the exact timeline. When does the keynote start? When are breaks? When's networking? I need to know the <strong>key moments</strong> in advance so I don't miss them.</p><h2>3. Filming Permissions</h2><p>Venue, organiser, sponsors — everyone needs to know filming is happening. You need written consent from the venue and informed attendees. GDPR is real.</p><h2>4. Audio Setup</h2><p>70% of video quality is sound. Will speakers have mics? Can we get audio from the mixing desk? Or do we need our own wireless mics? This needs to be sorted <strong>at least 1 week before</strong>.</p><h2>5. Branding Assets</h2><p>Logo in vector format, brand colours, fonts. I need these for lower thirds, intro/outro screens. The sooner I get them, the faster I deliver.</p><h2>6. Interview List</h2><p>Who do you want in interviews? CEO? Keynote speakers? Attendees? <strong>Prepare a list + rough questions</strong>. This is how we get authentic, useful responses.</p><h2>7. Backup Plan</h2><p>What if the power goes out? What if the keynote speaker cancels? What if it rains and the garden party moves indoors? Having a backup plan eliminates chaos.</p><h2>8. Deliverables Definition</h2><p>What exactly do you want? Highlight video? Interviews? Full-length recording? Instagram stories? YouTube version? <strong>Defining deliverables upfront</strong> saves time and money in post-production.</p><h2>9. B-Roll Opportunities</h2><p>B-roll is the footage that gives your video atmosphere: food details, handshakes, arrivals, branding on walls. Tell me what's <strong>visually interesting</strong> about your event so I can capture it.</p><h2>10. Post-Event Debrief</h2><p>After the event, a short call: What worked? What could be better? Which moments stood out? This improves every future project.</p><p><strong><a href='/services/international-event-video'>Planning an event?
