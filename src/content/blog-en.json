Get straight to the point.</p><h2>2. Bad Lighting</h2><p>You don't need a hundred-thousand-dollar camera, but you need light. Daylight from a window is free and looks great.</p><h2>3. Missing Captions</h2><p>Up to 40% of people watch videos without sound. If you don't have captions, you lose half your audience.</p><h2>4. No Call to Action (CTA)</h2><p>What should people do after watching? Tell them. 'Follow for more tips', 'Click the link in bio'.</p><h2>5. Boring</h2><p>Entertain, educate, inspire.

High-End Tech?</h3><p>Are we shooting on an iPhone or a RED camera? Do we need a drone? Light setup?</p><h3>3. Post-production</h3><p>Editing, coloring, sound, music, graphics.
