## 📞 What To Say When Someone Asks "Why You?"

### For Event Video:
"I specialize in international B2B events. I'm bilingual (English/Czech) so I can cover events with international attendees seamlessly. I've filmed events in Prague and I'm expanding to Berlin and London. My filmmaker background means I bring cinematic quality, but I understand the business goals - your video needs to generate ROI, not just look pretty."

### For Event Moderation:
"I'm a bilingual conference moderator with a unique background as a filmmaker, so I'm extremely comfortable on camera and on stage. I can moderate in English or Czech, switch seamlessly between languages, and I understand how to work with video crews to create great content. I'm professional, well-prepared, and I keep your event running on time while keeping the energy high."

### For Why International:
"I'm based in Prague but I travel throughout Europe for events. Being bilingual makes me especially valuable for international conferences where you need someone who can communicate equally well with Czech and international guests. I quote all-inclusive prices - travel, accommodation, everything - so there are no surprise costs."
